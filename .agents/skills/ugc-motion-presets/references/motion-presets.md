# Motion Presets

45 recipes, each an original Seedance 2.5 direction composed for this
workspace. Recipes are creative heuristics — no preset is ranked over another
by any measured claim.

**Read only the category section containing the resolved preset.** Each recipe
fills the six-part formula slots per the skill's composition rules; cross-cut
constraints live in [execution-constraints.md](execution-constraints.md).

Duration values are single-pass suggestions for the API `duration` parameter;
ratio defaults to 9:16 everywhere and is omitted from recipes.
