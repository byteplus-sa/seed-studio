# Execution Constraints

Cross-cutting Seedance 2.5 constraints that every preset recipe inherits.
`seedance-prompt-25` owns the prompt grammar; the caller owns the tool
parameters outside this workspace. This file maps where recipes touch them,
with the four flagged presets resolved in detail. All parameters below are
tool/API values — they never appear in prompt text.

## Parameter map

| Parameter | Value and notes |
|---|---|
| `duration` | Integer seconds, 4–30; `-1` for auto. Integer only — no sub-second values. |
| `resolution` | `480p`, `720p`, `1080p`. Default 720p for UGC placement. Standard 2.5 caps at 1080p; a 4K request needs legacy 2.0 or confirmed access and destination support for whitelist-only 2.5 Premium. |
| `ratio` | `9:16` default for UGC unless the request says otherwise. Locked to the first image on first/last-frame tasks and auto-derived from the source on edit tasks — never set it there. |
| Locked camera | State locked-off selfie/posing and spectacle framing in the prompt. Use a camera-lock parameter only if the destination exposes one. |
| `generate_audio` | Enables the native audio track the recipes describe. |
| `watermark` | `false` by default (the tool supports the parameter). |
| `return_last_frame` | `true` chains a scene into the next one's `first_frame` — used by multi-shot and long lifestyle recipes. |
| `priority` | 0–9; leave unset unless the caller specifies. |

## Task types

`omni_reference_task_type` accepts `auto`, `reference`, `edit`, and `extend`
on 2.5.

- **R2V recipes omit it** — the provider auto-detects from the prompt and
  media. Do not set `reference` on recipes; its behavior beyond auto-detection
  is undocumented.
- **Structured edits use `edit`** (subject replacement, outfit switch, hair
  style, creature integration over footage). `edit_video` is a 2.0-only value
  and is rejected by 2.5 with `InvalidParameter.TaskTypeConstraint`.
- **Continuation uses `extend`** (beta; ratio is locked to the source and
  stripped client-side).

## Reference and duration caps

- Seedance 2.5 accepts up to 30 images, 10 videos, and 10 audios (50 materials
  total). Recipes use 1–4; extra slots stay available for the caller's own
  references.
- Edit tasks: source video under 20s with 1–5 references recommended. Output
  duration locks to the source (~±0.3s) and ratio derives from the source.
- Modes are mutually exclusive: never mix first/last-frame roles with an R2V
  reference bundle in one task.

## Flagged presets — resolutions

Four presets map to no single direct provider mode. Their canonical
resolutions:

### Group Photo — subject multiplication
Duplicates are forbidden inside edit tasks ("never a second or duplicated
copy" of a subject), so the multiply gag is **generation-only**: a single-pass
R2V describing the staged appearance of identical figures at timestamps.
Identity drift across figures is the main failure mode — QA every figure
against the identity reference. The reliable alternative for a real group
photo is distinct references per person.

### Gas Transformation — disintegration
No direct disintegration mode exists. Two supported approximations:
1. **Staged single-pass** — the dissolve into smoke is written as an explicit
   end state ("by @9s only smoke remains"), with the dissolution spreading
   across named body regions at timestamps.
2. **Object-morph transition grammar** — "corresponding shapes, materials,
   transformation process," used when the vanish bridges two states.
QA the final frame: it must read as the intended vanish, not a corrupt frame.

### Timelapse Human — frozen subject, moving crowd
No crowd-freeze or timelapse-speed parameter exists. Approximation: state the
subject's stillness explicitly ("stands perfectly still, motionless for the
full duration") while background pedestrians move constantly at fast frequency
with motion blur, on a locked-off camera stated in the prompt. QA that the subject
actually holds — any subject drift breaks the effect.

### Morning routine — over-30s arc
Two supported paths:
1. **Compress** the arc into a ≤30s staged three-beat version (default in the
   recipe).
2. **Chain** three ~10s scenes via `return_last_frame: true` → `first_frame`,
   with matched aspect ratios and wardrobe continuity across scenes.

## Cross-cutting QA

- **Phone screens (selfie presets).** Avoid the picture-in-picture prior:
  describe the screen or mirror image positively, or attach a deterministic
  mockup as `@Image N`; never expect a rendered UI.
- **Labels and packaging (eating/product).** Exact text on plates, packaging,
  and cups is added in post by the destination workflow, never baked into
  generation.
- **Spatial continuity (action).** Name the start point, travel axis,
  boundary, and end state; never demand impossible movement frequencies.
- **Keyframe chains (multi-shot).** First and last images must share an aspect
  ratio; ordered multi-keyframe images are preferred over grids.
- **High-burst caution.** Explosions, splashes, and jumps use described,
  moderate dynamics — avoid unbounded debris and fragments around the subject.
- **Generation parameters stay in the API.** Duration, resolution, ratio, and
  watermark never go in the prompt text.
