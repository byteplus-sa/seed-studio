## Route selection

Every recast prompt has an `[Audio]` block that names one route.

| Route | Use when | Audio input | Lips |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Music-only** | No dialogue; the source music or a new track carries the beat | Separated source music as `@Audio 1`, a new approved track, or native generation | No speech |
| **Keep source dialogue** | New cast says the same words in the same voices | Separated source dialogue as `@Audio 1`, or inherited from `@Video 1` | Re-rendered to the kept words |
| **Replace voice** | Same words, new voice for the new character | New approved voice track, or a timbre reference plus the exact lines | Re-rendered to the new track |
| **Re-voice or translate** | Same meaning in another language, or a rewritten line | Exact new lines in `{}`, optional timbre reference | Re-rendered to the new words |
| **Post audio** | Sound is designed and mixed in assembly | None; native audio off or discarded | Only if no one speaks on screen |

Voice rules:

- Keeping a real person's recorded voice, or cloning its timbre for a new
  character, requires that person's recorded voice consent, separate from
  footage rights and image likeness. See the
  [production policy](../../../contracts/production-policy.md).
- Separate lip-sync audio is opt-in. When the user asks for it, follow the
  [audio-video alignment contract](../../../contracts/audio-video-alignment.md):
  exact dialogue in both prompts, audio duration verified before handoff,
  and a new review when audio changes.
- When lips are off-screen or not the focus, a voice overlay in post, done in
  the destination workflow, avoids re-rendering the mouth.

## Provisional default

Which source-audio binding keeps dialogue and lip sync best in a recast is
unverified. Treat the defaults below as provisional until a low-cost 480p probe
on owned or synthetic dialogue footage compares them, and record the result in
the project.

- **Dialogue clips:** candidate default is the separated source dialogue bound
  as `@Audio 1`, stated as the dialogue and speaking times, with `@Video 1`
  still motion-only. The alternative to compare is `@Video 1` alone carrying
  its audio, with the Audio block saying to keep its dialogue.
- **Music clips:** separated source music as `@Audio 1`, or a new approved
  track when the music changes.

Whatever the probe shows, change one binding at a time and keep the rest of the
prompt stable, so the cause of any change is identifiable.

## Route sentences

Music-only, keeping the source track:

```text
[Audio]
@Audio 1 is the soundtrack from the source; keep it unchanged and on the same
beat. Add <ambience of the new location> under it. No one speaks.
```

Music-only, new track:

```text
[Audio]
@Audio 1 defines the music: (upbeat synth-pop at the source tempo). Keep the
dance on its beat. No one speaks.
```

Keep source dialogue:

```text
[Audio]
@Audio 1 defines the dialogue and speaking times. Mara speaks the first line
and Theo the second, exactly as in @Audio 1; their lips move with those words.
Add <new location ambience> under the dialogue.
```

Replace voice:

```text
[Audio]
@Audio 1 defines only Mara's voice timbre, accent and pacing; use none of its
words. Mara says, with the same timing as the source line: {<exact line>}
```

Re-voice or translate:

```text
[Audio]
Mara says, in natural <language>, with the same delivery and speaking times as
the source line: {<exact translated line>}. Her lips move with the new words.
```

Post audio:

```text
[Audio]
No dialogue. Keep only quiet <location ambience>; music and sound design are
added in post.
```

Speaker ownership comes from the speech windows in your source inspection. Map each window to one named character; a line whose speaker is
removed or turned into a background extra needs an explicit decision (cut the
line, give it to a mapped character, or keep it off-screen).

## Preparing source audio

Audio preparation happens on the user's side, in the destination workflow; this
workspace does not separate, trim, transcode or transcribe media. State these
needs in the package so the user can prepare the files:

1. Separate voice and background from the source with a tool of the user's
   choice, and name the time range.
2. Trim the separated track to the exact source span bound as `@Video 1`. A
   trimmed probe clip needs a matching trimmed audio file.
3. Verify the track duration against the planned output duration; combined
   audio inputs stay within 30 s.
4. Transcribe the kept dialogue and keep the word timings as the reference for
   lip-sync checks.

## Lip-sync QA

Apply when any character speaks on screen:

- Transcribe the output audio (user-side) and diff it against the intended lines. Kept
  dialogue matches the source; replaced or translated lines match the approved
  script; timbre references contribute no words.
- Check speaker ownership: each line comes from the mapped character's mouth,
  never from a removed subject or an extra.
- Step through close frames on plosives (p, b, m) and open vowels; mouth shapes
  land on the audible sounds.
- Measure the audio-to-mouth offset at two or three distinct syllables; an
  offset that grows across the clip suggests a duration mismatch.
- Listen in full. Loudness readings and waveforms do not replace listening.
- For a replaced voice, compare timbre against the approved voice and ask for a
  human listen.
