  Write Seedance 2.5 Restyle prompts that redraw an entire existing clip in a
  new visual style (2D cel anime, watercolor, claymation, needle felt, toy
  miniature, stylized 3D, pixel art, woodblock, film noir and 20+ more, or a
  custom style reference image) while keeping its performance, subject
  positions, motion, camera path, cuts and timing. Covers the style catalog, the
  style-only reference role, medium-matched Virtual Portrait identity anchors,
  an environment-image recipe that restyles the background while keeping the
  same place, edit and reference routes, a muted source master with audio added
  in post, a 480p probe ladder, and restyle checks. Use to turn live action into
  animation, change the medium of an animated clip, or match a house style.
  Prompt-only: never generates or submits. Not for replacing the cast or world
  (seedance-motion-recast), swapping one element (seedance-object-swap), or
  grading or relighting the original look (seedance-vfx-prompt).

# Seedance Restyle

Restyle redraws every frame in a new medium. The same people do the same things
in the same place with the same camera; only the way the world is rendered
changes.

## Boundary

| Need | Skill | What survives from the source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Same shot in a new visual medium | this skill | Content, layout, identity cues, motion, camera, cuts, timing |
| New cast or world doing the same performance | `seedance-motion-recast` | Motion, camera and timing only |
| One element replaced | `seedance-object-swap` | Every pixel outside the element |
| Grade, relight, weather or effects on the original look | `seedance-vfx-prompt` | The photographed medium |

When the style should also change who appears (for example, the restyled
figures should not depict the source people), map them to new characters: that
is a Motion Transfer.

## Input and output contract

Input:

- A source clip inspected per the
  [video-to-video inputs contract](../../contracts/video-to-video-inputs.md),
  with rights the user has confirmed for the footage and the people in it.
- The muted master and the saved source audio, prepared by the user.
- One style: a catalog ID from the [style catalog](references/style-catalog.md),
  or one to three custom style reference images (user-owned or approved
  generated frames).
- Optional identity anchors: Virtual Portrait `asset://` views of recurring
  characters, designed in the target style.
- The post-audio route.

Output: a restyle package delivered in chat, with ordered bindings and roles,
the content inventory, the style block, the prompt, the route and parameter
block, the post-audio route, and the test-ladder rung.

## Hard rules

1. **The performance stays; the medium changes.** Keep the subject count, their
   screen positions, actions, props, the furniture they use and identity cues
   (hair shape, wardrobe colours, silhouettes). The background keeps its place
   and is restyled through an environment image of that place (rule 9). Read
   [restyle grammar](references/restyle-grammar.md).
2. **One style per take, applied to everything.** People, props, set, sky and
   effects share one medium lock. Blends happen only on request.
3. **A style reference supplies style only**: medium, palette, line, texture
   and light quality. Never its subjects, layout or characters.
4. **No studio, artist or franchise names**, and no frames from copyrighted
   productions as style references. Copyright IP enters only as an asset the
   user is authorized to use.
5. **Realistic people are Virtual Portraits.** Recommend that the user upload
   the source clip, when it shows a person, and any identity anchors to the
   Virtual Portrait library and bind them as `asset://`, per the
   [video-to-video inputs contract](../../contracts/video-to-video-inputs.md).
   Rights and consent follow the
   [production policy](../../contracts/production-policy.md): unknown rights,
   identity and consent facts stop the work, and a creative choice never
   supplies them. Identity anchors are designed in the target medium: a photoreal sheet under
   a drawn style leaks photoreal skin.
6. **Bind the muted master** with `generate_audio: false` and no `@Audio`
   binding; sound returns in post.
7. **No baked text.** Source signage becomes abstract shapes in the style;
   captions and copy are added in post.
8. **Test ladder**: a 480p probe of the hardest beat (fast motion, a face close-up
   or a cut), then the full clip at 480p, then the final resolution. Each rung is
   a separate prompt block, pasted and judged by the user before the next.
9. **Keep the same place.** A restyle changes how the background looks, never
   where the scene is: a city street stays a city street, with the same kind of
   buildings, furniture and plants. Never name a different location unless the
   user asks for one. Words alone do not restyle the street, so write an
   environment image prompt of the same place and bind the approved image (see
   Environment image).
10. **Frame count.** Edit routes take an 8n+1 frame input (for example 121 at
    24 fps) and return the same count.

## Routes

Upstream probes on 2026-10-03 and 2026-10-04 (480p, 5 s, claymation, one person
at a café table on a Paris street, locked camera, source bound as an
`asset://` video) showed what keeps the place and changes its medium, and what
does not:

- **Environment image of the same place: whole frame in clay, still the same
  kind of place.** An empty clay Parisian café terrace (cream stone buildings
  with balconies, wooden bench, shrub, café table), generated from a text
  description of the source's place and bound as `@Image 1`, with "Replace the
  scene with the claymation café terrace from @Image 1" on the edit route, or
  the same image on the reference route. The street, buildings, bench, shrub
  and table all became clay, it remained a Paris café terrace, and the motion,
  timing and camera held. The street's exact geometry follows the image, not
  the source plate, and a stray object in the image can leak into the video.
- **Words only, keeping the place** (seven runs: restyle wording at three
  strengths, every surface named, "same positions" and "same layout" on both
  routes, a background-only edit, and a background-only second pass): only the
  person, and on the reference route the near furniture, became clay. The street
  stayed photographic. A background-only edit on the original turned the woman to
  clay as well, despite "leave her as filmed", and a background-only second pass
  on a clay-woman output changed the street's shops and added lettering without
  making it clay.
- **Words only, naming a different place** (a seaside village): the whole frame
  became clay on both routes, but the scene moved from a city to the sea. Use it
  only when the user asks for a different place.
- **Style frames made by restyling photos** (three Seedream clay frames of the
  source): the background stayed photographic, because the frames were
  themselves only partly restyled, and the woman's hair colour leaked.

Untested: an environment image derived from the source plate (so the street
geometry matches the source), other styles (a 2D style may redraw a whole frame
more easily than sculpted clay), and 720p or 1080p.

**If the request allows no image input at all,** a same-place background restyle
is not reliable today. Say so, and offer: an environment image the user
generates from a prompt you write (the user supplies nothing), a subject-only restyle, or, only if the user
wants it, a different place described in words.

These are parameter-block values for the destination UI, never prompt text:

- **Route A (default): full-frame edit with an environment image of the same
  place.** `omni_reference_task_type: edit`, `@Video 1` as editing master,
  ratio and duration locked to the source. Use an 8n+1 frame input (for example
  121 frames at 24 fps): it returned exactly 121 frames, while a 120-frame input
  returned 113 (4.71 s vs 5.00 s, inside the 0.3 s tolerance). Without an
  environment image this route changes only the subject.
- **Route B (alternative): reference.** `auto`, or `reference` when the
  destination UI lists it, with `@Video 1` as the authority for motion, timing
  and camera, a detailed shot-by-shot description, and the same environment
  image. Set `ratio` to the source and `duration` to the whole-second source
  length. Use it when Route A keeps photoreal pixels or the duration must be
  exact.

Both routes bind `@Video 1` as an `asset://` video when the source shows a
person. Bind the environment image, then style images and identity anchors, as
`reference_image` after `@Video 1`; 1–5 images for Route A; `watermark: false`.
Confirm the model ID and the accepted parameters in the destination UI or the
current documentation before finalizing the parameter block.

### Environment image

Write one for every whole-frame restyle. Describe the source's own place in the
target medium (the same city, building style, furniture, plants and light) as
a Seedream text-to-image prompt for the empty set: no people, no props the
shot does not have. Do not make it by restyling a photo of the source; that left
the background photographic. When the user shares the generated image, check
that it reads as the same place as the source and holds no stray objects, then
bind the approved image with an Environment Reference Role that names what to
use and what to ignore (extra chairs, objects, people). Each stray object can
leak into the video.

## Procedure

1. **Route check.** The request changes the look, not the cast or one element.
2. **Source intake.** Inspect the source, confirm rights, and tell the user how
   to trim and mute it.
3. **Content inventory.** List subjects with observable descriptors, key
   props, set layout, cuts, fast-motion windows and on-screen text.
4. **Style.** Pick a catalog entry or write a custom recipe from the user's
   style images; confirm the cadence note for stop-motion styles.
   For a whole-frame restyle, also write the environment image prompt of the
   same place (see Environment image); words alone leave the street
   photographic.
5. **Anchors.** For recurring characters, write medium-matched sheet prompts
   and recommend the Virtual Portrait upload of the approved views.
6. **Prompt.** Assemble the route template in
   [restyle grammar](references/restyle-grammar.md).
7. **Deliver** bindings, inventory, style block, prompt, parameter block, audio
   route and rung in chat.
8. **Acceptance checks.** When the user shares or describes the output, run
   [restyle checks](references/restyle-qa.md); after the user muxes the
   post-audio route, apply the audio checks.

Medium recipes in `seedance-animation-styles` and look presets in
`seedance-motion-recast` share vocabulary with this catalog; Seedream sheet and
environment prompts follow `seedream-character-sheet` and
`seedream-location-asset`. These are composition hints; this leaf does not load
sibling skills.

## Prompt-only boundary and failure behavior

This skill writes prompts only. It returns a paste-ready prompt package for
Lumina or another Seed-model UI and never generates, uploads, registers assets,
submits, polls or deletes anything, and never trims, separates or muxes media.
An unverified route, missing rights or an unapproved style reference stays an
open item. A provider rejection the user reports follows the rejection rule in
the
[video-to-video inputs contract](../../contracts/video-to-video-inputs.md#provider-rejections).
