## Authority split

| Input | Owns | Supplies none of |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `@Video 1` muted master | Subjects and their count, their screen positions, actions, poses, props, the furniture they use, camera path, cuts, timing, and which place the scene is in | Rendering medium, surface texture, grade |
| Environment `@Image N` | How the same place looks in the target medium: street, buildings, sky, background furniture | People, the place itself (it must depict the source's place), props the shot lacks |
| Style `@Image N` | Medium, palette, line quality, texture, light quality | Subjects, layout, characters, text |
| Identity anchor `@Image N` | One character's design in the target medium | Pose, background, lighting of the sheet |
| Text | The style block, content inventory, guards | Motion already in `@Video 1` |

Describe content only as an inventory that pins who and what must survive.
Retelling every move conflicts with the video.

**The place stays the same.** The background is restyled, never replaced with a
different location. Words alone did not do it: five words-only runs that kept the
place (restyle wording, every surface named, "same positions", "same layout")
left the street photographic. Describing a different place in words did rebuild
the frame, but moved the scene from a city to the sea, so it is not a restyle.
Use an environment image of the same place.

## Route A: full-frame edit

```text
[Edit Goal]
Edit @Video 1. Replace the scene with the <style name> <the source's place> from
@Image 1, and restyle <the people and props> as <style name>. Keep every
subject, action, prop, camera and timing from @Video 1.

[Source Video Role]
@Video 1 is the sole editing master. It defines <subject inventory>, <key
props>, <the furniture the subject uses>, the static camera, <their> poses and
actions, and event order.

[Environment Reference Role]
@Image 1 defines the whole environment: <the source's place in the target
medium: city, buildings, furniture, plants>. Use it for <street, buildings,
sky, bench, shrub, table surface>. Use no person from it. Do not use its <extra
objects it holds>. The only objects on <surface> are <the source's objects>, one
of each, never a second or duplicated copy.

[Edit Scope]
Replace the scene with @Image 1: <each background element> is the modelled
<medium> of @Image 1, in the same positions as the source. <Subject>, <wardrobe
and accessories> and <props> are also rendered in <medium>. Exactly <N> people
appear in the foreground; <background extras>. <Source text surface> shows
<abstract shapes>; no lettering appears anywhere.

[Timeline Inheritance]
Every pose, gesture and contact keeps the timing and screen position of
@Video 1: <beats with times>. <Cadence note for stepped styles.>

[Content to Preserve]
Keep <identity cues>, <props>, <furniture position>, the static camera and the
whole performance from @Video 1.

[Style]
<catalog fragment or custom recipe>

[Audio]
Silent output. Sound is added in post.
```

Optional blocks, added before `[Edit Scope]`:

```text
[Style Reference Role]          (only with style images)
@Image 2 defines only the visual style: <medium, palette, line, texture,
light quality>. Use none of its subjects, layout or characters.

[Identity Anchors]              (only with anchors)
@Image 3 defines <Name>'s design in <style>: <hair shape, wardrobe colours>.
<Name> is <observable descriptor in @Video 1>.
```

## Route B: reference

Use when a Route A probe keeps photographic pixels or the duration must be
exact. Set `duration` to the whole-second source length and `ratio` to the
source.

```text
Create a new video using @Video 1 as the strict visual and temporal reference.
Follow the output dimensions and duration selected in the generation settings.

[Timeline fidelity: highest priority]
Each output moment corresponds to the same moment in @Video 1 at the same
playback speed, from the first frame to the last. Keep the static camera, the
screen positions, and every pose, gesture and contact in the same order and at
the same time as in @Video 1.

[Reference content]
@Video 1 defines only the motion, timing, screen positions and camera. Use none
of its photographic surfaces, faces, wardrobe or location.
- 0:00 to 0:NN: <what happens>
- 0:NN to 0:NN: <what happens>

[World]
@Image 1 defines the whole world: <the source's place in the target medium>.
Everything in the video is modelled <medium> in the same layout. Do not use its
<extra objects it holds>. The only objects on <surface> are <the source's
objects>, one of each, never a second or duplicated copy.

[Characters and props]
<The subject> is a <medium> figure with <hair>, <accessories>, <wardrobe>, and a
hand-modelled face. <Props> are <medium>. Exactly <N> people appear in the
foreground; <background extras>. No lettering appears anywhere.

[Style]
<catalog fragment or custom recipe>

[Audio]
Silent output. Sound is added in post.
```

## A different place, only when requested

When the user explicitly asks for a different location, a words-only block
rebuilt the whole frame in a 2026-10-04 probe on both routes (a clay seaside
village in place of a Paris street). Use it only on request, never as a way to
restyle the background of the same scene:

```text
[Location Change]
The background and the overall location both change. <The source's street,
buildings, plant, bench and sky> of @Video 1 are all removed, and no part of the
original <location> remains. In their place is a different location: <the new
place in the target medium, left to right and near to far>. Every part of the
new location is modelled <medium>.
```

## Style reference images

- One to three images, user-owned or approved generated frames. One image per
  frame; no collage or mood board.
- Prefer frames whose content differs from the source, so the model reads them
  as style rather than layout.
- No people's faces in style images; when a style image needs a character,
  use an identity anchor instead.
- Never use frames from copyrighted productions or name a studio, artist or
  franchise.
- When the style images and the catalog fragment disagree, the images win;
  shorten the fragment to the medium only.

## Identity anchors

Restyle keeps identity as shapes and colours. For a recurring character that
must look the same across takes:

1. Write a Seedream sheet prompt for the character in the target medium; the
   user generates and approves it.
2. Recommend that the user upload the approved views as a Virtual Portrait
   subject named for the medium (`"Mara (claymation)"`), per the
   [video-to-video inputs contract](../../../contracts/video-to-video-inputs.md).
3. Bind it after the style images and map it to the source subject by
   observable descriptor.

A single-take restyle without recurring characters needs no anchors.

## Worked example: terrace clip to claymation

Verified upstream on 2026-10-04: edit route, 480p, 121-frame muted source bound
as an `asset://` video, one environment image of the same place.

Source: a 5 s, 16:9 locked-off clip. A woman with shoulder-length dark hair, a
navy jacket over a cream top and a small gold hoop earring sits at a small round
café table with a Paris street, a green plant and a wooden bench behind her.
She holds a red can in her right hand beside a white espresso cup, lifts it to
her lips at about 0:01, drinks until about 0:03, and sets it down by about
0:04.5. Rights: generated clip, confirmed by the user. Post-audio route: original.

Environment image (Seedream text-to-image, 2048x1152, empty set, same place):

```text
Task:
Text-to-Image (T2I)

Subject:
Empty plasticine claymation miniature set of a Parisian café terrace seen from a fixed medium-distance camera: a small round café table with a thin brass rim in the lower-left foreground with one white espresso cup on it, a long curved wooden café bench behind the table, a potted green shrub pressed from clay leaves at the right edge, and a street of cream-coloured stone buildings with balconies, windows and shop fronts receding behind. Shop signs are coloured clay shapes. The set holds no people and no cans.

Style:
Handmade plasticine claymation: every surface, including the street, buildings, sky, shrub, bench and table, is modelled clay with visible thumbprints, fingerprint ridges and tool marks, a matte clay sheen and slightly uneven hand-shaped edges.

Lighting:
Soft warm daylight key from frame left with gentle shadows, like a small tabletop set.

Composition:
Wide 16:9 frame matching a locked-off medium shot: table in the lower left, shrub at the right edge, street receding behind, pale clay sky above.

Constraints:
Quality: crisp sculpted clay detail
Negative: no people, no photograph, no live-action look, no readable text, no logos, no watermarks
```

Edit prompt, with the image bound as `@Image 1`:

```text
[Edit Goal]
Edit @Video 1. Replace the scene with the claymation café terrace from @Image 1, and restyle the woman and her props as plasticine claymation. Keep every subject, action, prop, set layout, camera and timing from @Video 1.

[Source Video Role]
@Video 1 is the sole editing master. It defines the woman with shoulder-length dark hair in a navy jacket over a cream top, the red aluminium can in her right hand, the white espresso cup, the small round café table, the static camera, her poses and actions, and event order.

[Environment Reference Role]
@Image 1 defines the whole environment: a plasticine café terrace with a round café table, a curved wooden bench behind it, a pressed-clay shrub at the right, and a street of cream stone buildings with balconies and coloured clay shop fronts. Use it for the street, buildings, sky, bench, shrub and table surface. Use no person from it. Do not use its chair, ashtray, saucer or second cup. The only objects on the table are the white espresso cup and the red can from @Video 1, one of each, never a second or duplicated copy.

[Edit Scope]
Replace the scene with @Image 1: the street, the buildings, the sky, the wooden bench, the shrub and the table are the modelled clay of @Image 1, with visible thumbprints and tool marks, in the same positions as the source. The woman, her navy jacket and cream top, her small gold hoop earring, the red can and the white espresso cup are also modelled in plasticine. One person appears in the foreground; the distant passers-by stay as tiny blurred clay figures. No lettering appears anywhere, including on the can.

[Timeline Inheritance]
Every pose, gesture and contact keeps the timing and screen position of @Video 1: the can held at the start, lifted to her lips at about 0:01, drunk from until about 0:03, and set on the table by about 0:04.5. A slightly stepped stop-motion cadence still hits each of those poses on the beat.

[Content to Preserve]
Keep her identity cues, the can, the cup, the table position, the static camera and the whole performance from @Video 1.

[Style]
Plasticine claymation throughout: visible thumbprints, fingerprint ridges and tool marks, a matte clay sheen, soft warm key light on a small tabletop set, and slightly stepped stop-motion cadence.

[Audio]
Silent output. Sound is added in post.
```

Parameter block: `omni_reference_task_type: edit`, `generate_audio: false`,
`resolution: 480p`, `watermark: false`; `ratio` and `duration` omitted.

Result: the street, buildings, bench, shrub and table became clay and it stayed a
Paris café terrace, while the woman, can and cup kept their motion and timing;
121 frames in, 121 out. The same image on the reference route gave the same kind
of result. The street's geometry follows the image, not the source plate. Once
the user accepts the take, they mux the saved source audio.
