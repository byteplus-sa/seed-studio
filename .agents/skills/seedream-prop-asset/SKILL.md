# Seedream Prop Asset

Write production-grade prompts for BytePlus Seedream prop and product identity
sheets. This skill is for **objects**: held and operated props, hero objects the
camera lingers on, recurring products, vehicles, devices, mechanisms, and
wearables that appear in only some scenes. The output is a paste-ready prompt
block; the image the user generates from it becomes a reusable prop reference
for Seedance, storyboards, or later Seedream I2I.

Use this skill when the user wants:
- a prop sheet or prop reference
- a product identity reference for video
- a vehicle, device, tool, or mechanism reference
- a scene-variant wearable (sunglasses, a jacket, a mask) kept off the
  character sheet
- a state variant of an approved prop (open/closed, lit/unlit, intact/broken)
- a continuity mark on a character's body (birthmark, tattoo, scar), see
  Body continuity marks below

Do **not** use this skill for:
- always-worn outfit items, which stay in the character sheet
- locations, set dressing, or furniture that belongs to a place
- commercial product scenes, hero ads, or packshots set in an environment
- exact labels, logos, packaging copy, UI screens, or product lineups
- local edits to an approved prop image

Composition hints: `seedream-character-sheet` owns people and always-worn
outfits, `seedream-location-asset` owns places, and `seedream-prompt` owns
general product imagery. Point and box edits, exact copy, and layout are out of
scope in this workspace.

## Source authority

This skill follows the Seedream prompt structure from `seedream-prompt` and
adapts it for prop and product identity references.

they conflict.

## Prompt-only boundary

This skill writes prompts only. It returns one of three outcomes without
loading sibling skills: a paste-ready prompt package, a text-only descriptor
when the gate says no sheet is needed, or a reuse-or-acquire handoff with no
prompt when a real asset should be used instead. It never generates images,
submits or polls tasks, uploads or downloads files, or edits images. The user
pastes the block into Lumina or another Seed-model UI. A draft does not
establish approval.

## Gate: does this prop need a sheet?

Identify every visible object, then apply the threshold. A prop needs a
**locked reference** only when at least one row says yes. When the user
explicitly asks for a sheet of an object below the threshold, write it and note
that it is below the threshold:

| Criterion | Example | Locked reference? |
|---|---|---|
| Branded product with a logo or specific design, when the brief authorizes the real brand | canned tuna, fiber modem, phone with app UI | Yes — acquire first |
| The camera lingers on it or it drives the plot | a key, a letter, a device screen the camera shows | Yes |
| It recurs across two or more shots or scenes | the same phone in several ads | Yes |
| Scene-variant wearable | sunglasses worn in some scenes only | Yes |
| Generic, unbranded, briefly visible | a coffee cup, a cake, a tablet in a montage | No — describe in text |
| Held for one or two seconds in one shot | a pen, a glass of water | No — describe in text |

A locked reference is an approved asset the user holds, not automatically a
Seedream generation. Choose the source in this order:

1. **Reuse** an approved prop image the user already has for this identity.
2. **Acquire** — ask the user for an official, authorized, or user-supplied
   image when the brief authorizes a real brand, logo, or labeled product, or
   the user has a photo of the object. This skill never downloads it. An
   unknown or unauthorized brand stays de-identified and is described with
   placeholder descriptors.
3. **Write a sheet prompt** with this skill only when no usable real asset
   exists, the user asks for a stylized or fictional substitute, or
   acquisition is blocked.

The contract's reuse, hash-check, and provenance steps, and its requirement
that the user approve an acquired asset before prompts depend on it, are in
[element identification](../../contracts/element-identification.md).

When the gate says text-only, return a short object descriptor for the scene
prompt instead of a sheet prompt. When in doubt about an unbranded object,
describe it in the video prompt and skip the Element.

## Default production rule

Choose the layout for each image.

**Hero view (default).** One isolated object in a three-quarter view from
slightly above eye level, the whole object in frame with margin on every side.
Use it for compact rigid objects seen mainly from one side.

**Multi-view sheet.** Two or three panels of the same object in one horizontal
row: a three-quarter hero view, a side profile or back view, and an optional
close-up of an identity-critical detail. Use it when the object is seen from
several sides, is large or mechanical (vehicles, machines, doors), or carries a
detail too small to read in the hero view.

A single `front`, `side`, `top`, or `edge` view is still valid when a shot
needs one specific angle.

**Background.** Pure white seamless with only a faint contact shadow directly
beneath the object, so the backdrop does not leak into generated video. Switch
to neutral light gray when the object is white, silver, or chrome, or is clear
or translucent and its silhouette would be lost on white — check the candidate
before choosing — or when the project's approved props or character sheets
already use gray. Gray keeps the same faint contact shadow. Never use a
colored, gradient, textured, or scene background. A transparent delivery asset
is a separate output; never key the white reference into transparency.

**Lighting.** Neutral, even studio light with neutral white balance, identical
across panels. Controlled shape-revealing highlights on metal, glass, and gloss
are allowed, as is a gentle raking light to read embossing, engraving, or
texture. No scene mood or color cast.

**One canonical state.** Each image shows one state, stated explicitly: closed
or open, folded or extended, screen off or a specified screen, unlit or
glowing. Default to the state seen most on camera. Every other state needed on
camera gets its own image in the same element folder, reusing the identity
descriptor word for word.

## Flexible prompt structure

Use this order for the sections that apply. Do not add empty boilerplate:

- **References** only when images are provided
- **Task** when the mode needs clarification
- **Subject** for every prop image
- **Setting** for every prop image, because it fixes the background
- **Style** and **Lighting** when they add relevant direction
- **Composition** for every prop image
- **Text in image** only when non-exact model text is expressly accepted
- **Constraints** only for useful quality, continuity, and exclusion requirements

## 1. References (when provided)

List every reference image the user provides, in order:

```text
References:
@Image 1: approved prop sheet or authorized product photo — shape, proportions, materials
@Image 2: style reference — project render style
@Image 3: material or finish reference
```

Rules:
- Omit the References section when no images are provided.
- An approved prop image or authorized product photo is the highest-priority
  identity reference and goes first.
- Bind every reference again where it controls the output: "Use the shape,
  proportions, and paint layout from @Image 1, the render style from @Image 2,
  and the brushed-steel finish from @Image 3." A reference inventory alone is
  not sufficient.
- For a continuity mark on a character's body, see Body continuity marks below.

## 2. Task type

Use **Text-to-Image (T2I)** only when the prompt uses no reference images.

Use **Image-to-Image (I2I)** whenever any reference guides shape, material,
style, state, or another visible property. This includes first-pass sheets built
from photos or concept art, and every state variant of an approved prop.

## 3. Subject

```text
Subject:
[Prop reference of one <object>: silhouette and proportions, real-world size, materials and finish, colors, identity-critical details, wear, canonical state, count.]
```

Always include:
- **the object and its count** — "one coin only"; for a matched set, the exact
  number and that every item shares one design
- **silhouette and proportions** first, then materials and color
- **real-world size in words** — dimensions or a familiar comparison ("about one
  metre long", "palm-sized", "the size of a thumbnail"); never hands, rulers, or
  other objects in frame for scale
- **the few identity-critical details** the video must reproduce (a knurled grip
  band, a chrome hood ornament, rows of brass pegs); a complex object may need
  more, but each one earns its place
- **wear and age** only as far as the story needs; do not invent damage as a
  realism cue
- **the canonical state**, stated explicitly
- for a multi-view sheet, "the same object in all panels, identical design"

Copy the approved descriptor word for word into every later variant and every
prompt that binds the prop.

**Held props** appear without hands, with the grip area and any operated
controls visible.

**Wearables** appear unworn — no person, head, mannequin, or body part — in the
configuration seen on camera: glasses with temples open, a jacket laid flat.

**Surface print.** Unless exact text is required, prefer a blank surface or an
angle that hides the printed area, with soft focus on a deliberately hidden
face. Fine texture standing in for print tends to render as pseudo-letters, so
state "no readable text, letters, or numbers" and check the candidate for marks
that read as writing.

## 4. Setting

```text
Setting:
Isolated on a pure white seamless background with a single faint contact shadow directly beneath the object. No other objects.
```

Gray variant: "Neutral light-gray seamless studio background, consistent across
all panels, with a single faint contact shadow directly beneath the object. No
other objects."

## 5. Style

Match the project's approved render style so the prop sits in the same world as
its characters and locations. Pick 2–4 anchors:

- photorealistic product-reference photography, macro or 50mm lens, true
  material micro-texture
- stylized 3D animated-feature prop design, sculpted appealing forms, authored
  materials, not photoreal
- period-authentic production-design reference

For photoreal props, ask for honest material response and real micro-texture
rather than a waxy CGI finish.

## 6. Lighting

```text
Lighting:
Soft, even, neutral studio light, gentle fill, neutral white balance, controlled highlights on [metal/glass], identical across all panels.
```

No mood lighting, colored gels, hotspots, or blown highlights. Emissive parts
(screens, LEDs, lamps, magical glow) stay off unless the glowing state is the
canonical one.

## 7. Composition

Hero view:

```text
Composition:
Single isolated hero view, three-quarter angle from slightly above eye level, the whole object centered with margin on every side, deep focus across the object.
```

Multi-view sheet:

```text
Composition:
Three panels side by side in one horizontal row with even spacing: left, the whole object in a front three-quarter view; center, a full side profile; right, a close-up of [identity-critical detail]. Same object, scale, and lighting in every panel.
```

Core rules:
- the whole object fits inside every full-view panel — no cropped ends, wheels,
  handles, or straps
- one object per panel, unless the prop is a matched set or the user asks for a
  multi-prop board
- consistent scale between full-view panels
- the detail panel shows only a feature the full views cannot resolve
- three panels at most

## 8. Text in image

Omit by default. When readable copy carries identity (labels, wordmarks, plates,
packaging), use the first route that applies:

1. Use the real authorized asset the user supplies.
2. Write a text-free prop prompt here; exact copy is added in post by the
   destination workflow and is out of scope in this workspace. This suits flat,
   near-frontal surfaces with a blank label area; curved packaging or oblique
   views need the real asset.
3. Only when the user expressly accepts non-exact model text, quote it in double
   quotes with its surface, size, and color.

Never invent a real brand's logo. A device screen the camera shows is a
`screen_` reference: exact UI is out of scope in this workspace, and invented
screen imagery goes to `seedream-prompt`.

## 9. Constraints

```text
Constraints:
Quality: sharp material detail, consistent design across all panels
Negative: no hands, no people, no other objects, no readable text, no logos, no colored or gradient background, no cropped edges, no extra panels, no watermarks
```

Choose the negatives that apply:
- no hands, people, mannequins, or body parts
- no second object or duplicate
- no colored backdrop, gradient, scene, or floor texture
- no reflections of other objects
- no readable text, letters, numbers, logos, or brand marks
- no cropped object edges
- no extra panels
- no glow, beam, or effect unless canonical
- no watermark

## Standard prompt template

```text
Task:
Text-to-Image (T2I)

Subject:
Prop reference of one [object]: [silhouette and proportions], about [real-world size], [materials and finish], [colors], [2–4 identity-critical details], [canonical state]. One [object] only.

Setting:
Isolated on a pure white seamless background with a single faint contact shadow directly beneath the object. No other objects.

Style:
Photorealistic product-reference photography, 50mm lens, true material micro-texture, not CGI-waxy.

Lighting:
Soft, even, neutral studio light, gentle fill, neutral white balance, controlled highlights on [material].

Composition:
Single isolated hero view, three-quarter angle from slightly above eye level, the whole object centered with margin on every side, deep focus across the object.

Constraints:
Quality: sharp material detail, clean silhouette
Negative: no hands, no people, no other objects, no readable text, no logos, no colored or gradient background, no cropped edges, no watermarks
```

## Worked example: photoreal hero view

A hypothetical pattern without bundled result evidence. Brass reads clearly on
white, so the default background applies; the dial's cardinal points avoid
letters.

```text
Task:
Text-to-Image (T2I)

Subject:
Prop reference of one antique brass pocket compass, about five centimetres across: a round hinged case of worn polished brass with a domed lid standing open at ninety degrees, a cream enamel dial with a fine black compass rose whose cardinal points are small triangles, a slim blued-steel needle, a small knurled crown, and a brass suspension ring at the top. One compass only, lid open.

Setting:
Isolated on a pure white seamless background with a single faint contact shadow directly beneath the compass. No other objects.

Style:
Photorealistic product-reference photography, 50mm lens, true brass and enamel micro-texture, not CGI-waxy.

Lighting:
Soft, even, neutral studio light, gentle fill, neutral white balance, controlled highlights along the brass rim, no hotspots.

Composition:
Single isolated hero view, three-quarter angle from slightly above, the open lid and the dial both visible, the whole compass centered with margin on every side, deep focus across the object.

Constraints:
Quality: sharp material detail, clean silhouette
Negative: no hands, no chain, no other objects, no letters or numbers on the dial, no engraved text, no colored or gradient background, no cropped edges, no watermarks
```

## Worked example: stylized vehicle sheet

A hypothetical pattern without bundled result evidence. Polished chrome trim
and a project whose character sheets use gray call for the gray background.

```text
Task:
Text-to-Image (T2I)

Subject:
Vehicle prop sheet for an original stylized-3D animated family film: one small motorcycle-and-sidecar tricycle, about two metres long. A compact motorcycle with a rounded teal fuel tank and a single round headlight, joined on its right side to a boxy covered sidecar with a curved teal roof, a cream body with a hand-painted marigold-yellow stripe, a padded red vinyl bench seat, and polished chrome grab bars. A small chrome rooster ornament stands on the front of the sidecar roof. The plate holder is empty and blank. Parked upright, headlight off. The same tricycle in all three panels, identical design.

Setting:
Neutral light-gray seamless studio background, consistent across all three panels. No people, no other vehicles, no other objects.

Style:
Original stylized-3D family-feature animation vehicle design: rounded appealing proportions, tactile painted metal with a soft clear-coat, mirror-polished chrome, clean animated-feature render quality. Not photoreal, not flat 2D.

Lighting:
Soft, even, neutral studio light, flat fill, neutral white balance, soft controlled chrome highlights, identical across all panels.

Composition:
Three panels side by side in one horizontal row with even spacing: left, the whole tricycle in a front three-quarter view from eye level; center, a full side profile from the sidecar side with both wheels and the sidecar wheel fully visible; right, a close-up of the chrome rooster ornament on the sidecar roof. Same scale in the two full-view panels.

Constraints:
Quality: 16:9 horizontal sheet, crisp stylized detail, consistent vehicle design across all panels
Negative: no letters, no words, no numbers, no plate characters, no logos, no maker badges, no people, no driver, no other vehicles, no cropped wheels, no extra panels, no watermarks
```

## Body continuity marks

A birthmark, tattoo, or scar that must stay consistent across shots is a
close-up reference, not a prop sheet. Use I2I with the approved character sheet
bound for skin tone, build, and sleeve only, and describe the mark itself in
Subject: position in image terms, shape, size against a familiar object, color,
and edge quality. State laterality as seen in the frame and in the character's
own terms ("the inner LEFT wrist, as seen from the front"). Drop the body-part
and person negatives for this case and keep jewelry, tattoo, and second-hand
exclusions. The acceptance checks cover handedness, placement, shape, and
finger count.

## Acceptance checks for the user's candidates

Hand these checks off with the prompt so the user can judge the images they
generate. When the user shares a candidate and asks for a review, inspect it
against the same list and revise the prompt for any defect:

- the whole object is in frame with margin; nothing is cropped
- exactly the requested count; no duplicates, hands, people, or stray objects
- the background is the declared color and identical in every panel
- the silhouette separates cleanly from a uniform background
- identity-critical details read at thumbnail size
- no invented text, logos, or brand marks; marks that read as letters or
  numerals count as invented text
- scale and proportions are plausible for the stated size
- the state matches the request
- multi-view panels share one design, scale, and lighting

## Downstream binding

When a Seedance or storyboard prompt binds the approved prop:

- reference only the selected image whose state the shot needs
- copy the approved descriptor word for word
- for blockout or reference-to-video use, add "Use only the [prop] from
  @Image N — not its background."

## Saving drafts

Deliver the prompt in chat by default. Save a draft only when the user asks,
under `projects/<project>/prompts/`:

- `prompt_prop_<prop-id>_hero_v<NN>.md`
- `prompt_prop_<prop-id>_sheet_v<NN>.md`
- `prompt_prop_<prop-id>_<state>-hero_v<NN>.md` for a state variant

Name the user's selected image `prop_<prop-id>_<view>_v<NN>` when a later
prompt binds it. Images the user acquires for a real brand have no
`prompt_prop_` draft.

## Parameter block defaults

These are values the user sets in the destination UI, never prompt text:

- Model: `dola-seedream-5-0-pro-260628`
- Format: `png`
- Prompt optimization: `standard`
- Typical size:
  - `2048x2048` for hero and single views
  - `2816x1584` for multi-view sheets
- Watermark: off where the destination UI exposes it
