description: >-
  Review BytePlus Seedance, Seedream, and Seed Audio prompts with a sub-agent
  review pipeline and explicit model, operation, change contract, and request
  hash. Return rule findings and complete or incomplete status; fix and re-review
  changed prompts before generation. Use for video, VFX, Filipino dialogue,
  image/character/location/prop/UI/card/storyboard prompts, music, SFX, or ambience.
  Trigger when asked to review, QA, validate, or lint prompts, or before submitting
  newly authored generation prompts. Exclude manifest-only edits, generated-media
  review, and frozen snapshots unless re-review is explicitly requested.

# Prompt Review

A quality gate for prompts. The main agent writes prompts, a sub-agent reviews them
against the repo's skill best practices, and the main agent fixes any issues found.

## Core concept

```
Main agent writes/updates prompts
  → identify each prompt's type (Seedance 2.5, Seed Audio, Seedream, etc.)
  → load the matching review checklist from references/review-checklists.md
  → spawn a sub-agent: give it the prompt text + the checklist
  → sub-agent returns structured findings (issues by severity with suggested fixes)
  → main agent applies fixes to the prompt files
  → re-review only the changed prompts if any fixes were applied
```

## When to trigger

- After writing or updating any prompt for a BytePlus generative model.
- Before the user pastes a generation prompt into the destination UI (Seedance, Seed Audio, Seedream).
- When the user asks to review, check, QA, validate, or lint prompts.
- After revising a prompt based on generated output feedback.

Do not trigger for:
- Generated-media viewing (this workspace delivers prompts only; outputs are
  reviewed in the destination workflow).
- Manifest or scene definition edits (those are production metadata, not prompts).
- Prompts that have already been frozen as prompt snapshots unless the user explicitly
  asks to re-review a frozen snapshot.

## Creative-quality comparisons

For requested skill evaluation or alternative-draft assessment, read
[Creative Quality](references/creative-quality.md). Use brief-specific semantic
rubrics and evidence-backed blind comparisons. This offline assessment is
separate from production approval and does not require provider submission.

## Explicit review input

Collect `prompt_type`, `model`, `operation`, `language`, `requested_axes`,
`may_change`, `must_preserve`, and `request_sha256` alongside the complete prompt,
ordered reference roles/hashes, and capability evidence. The request hash covers
the semantic submitted request, not just its prompt. Missing dispatch or request
evidence leaves a production review `incomplete`; request it from the caller.
Filename/content inference is a draft-only fallback with an explicit warning.

For the same request, use generation rules for generate, 2.5 edit rules for a
2.5 edit, legacy VFX rules for a supported 2.0 edit, and extension rules for
extend. Language and named-axis checklists are additive only when applicable.
A localized change contract overrides generic preservation heuristics for items
under `may_change`; keep all `must_preserve` items unchanged.

## Prompt type detection

Use explicit input first; filenames below are fallback hints, not authority:

| Prompt type | File prefix | Checklist source |
|---|---|---|
| Seedance 2.5 video | `prompt_sNN_shNNN_tNN_vNN.md` | `seedance-prompt-25` |
| Seedance 2.0 video (4K/Fast/Mini) | `prompt_sNN_shNNN_tNN_vNN.md` | `seedance-prompt-20` |
| Seedance 2.5 edit | explicit model + edit operation | Seedance 2.5 edit section |
| Seedance VFX (video-to-video edit, legacy path) | `prompt_sNN_shNNN_tNN_vNN.md` | `seedance-vfx-prompt` |
| Seedance Filipino dialogue | `prompt_sNN_shNNN_tNN_vNN.md` | `seedance-prompt-25` + `seedance-prompt-25-filipino` |
| Seed Audio (dialogue/music/SFX/ambience) | `prompt_dlg_*`, `prompt_mus_*`, `prompt_sfx_*`, `prompt_amb_*`, `prompt_mix_*` | `seed-audio-prompt` |
| Seedream image generation | `prompt_concept_*`, `prompt_sNN_kf*` | `seedream-prompt` |
| Seedream character sheet | `prompt_char_*` | `seedream-character-sheet` |
| Seedream location asset | `prompt_loc_*` | `seedream-location-asset` |
| Seedream prop asset | `prompt_prop_*` | `seedream-prop-asset` |
| Seedream screen UI reference | `prompt_screen_*` | `seedream-prompt` (general image rules apply) |
| Seedream brand/title card | `prompt_card_*` | `seedream-prompt` (general image rules apply) |
| Storyboard prompts | `prompt_storyboard_*` (multi-panel) | `template-factory` (storyboard prompts) |
| Seedance music video | `prompt_sNN_shNNN_tNN_vNN.md` (song-driven) | `seedance-music-video` |

Deterministic HTML-entrypoint screens, cards, posters, product layouts, and
overlays are out of scope in this workspace and have no generation prompt; they
stay outside this table. Review only a generative image layer; deterministic
results are produced outside this workspace.

The "Checklist source" column is a provenance label only — this skill never loads
a sibling; the applicable checklist is always read from this skill's own bundled
`references/review-checklists.md`.

When a prompt could match multiple types (e.g., a Seedance 2.5 prompt with Filipino
dialogue), stack the checklists — the sub-agent checks against all applicable skills.

UGC intermediate outputs (hooks, scripts) are reviewed at **Stage 1** (before
composition into a final Seedance prompt). The final composed Seedance prompt is
reviewed at **Stage 2** against the Seedance 2.5 + Universal checklists. UGC
compliance audit runs **before Stage 1** — if it returns CRITICAL, stop the pipeline.

## Workflow

### Step 1 — Collect prompts to review

Gather all prompt files that were written or updated in the current session. These are
the files with the `prompt_` prefix that sit beside their media asset. Read each file
to get its full text.

If reviewing prompts that have not yet been saved to files (drafted inline in
working copy), extract the prompt text from the working copy. Before handoff,
freeze the accepted text as its immutable `prompt_*.md` snapshot (when the user
requested saved drafts) or deliver it in chat.

### Step 2 — Detect prompt type and load checklist

For each prompt:
1. Resolve its explicit model, operation, prompt type, and requested axes; use
   the table only for a warned draft fallback.
2. Read the corresponding section from `references/review-checklists.md`.
3. Also load the **universal directing principles** section (applies to all prompts).

### Step 3 — Spawn the review sub-agent

Delegate the review to a sub-agent. The sub-agent receives:
- The full text and explicit review input for each prompt being reviewed.
- The request hash, change contract, reference evidence, and applicable rule IDs.
- The applicable checklist section(s) from `references/review-checklists.md`.
- The universal directing principles.
- Clear instructions on what to check and how to report.

**Batching strategy:**
- All prompts of the same type → one sub-agent reviews them all in one pass.
- Prompts of different types → spawn one sub-agent per type, run in parallel.
- Maximum 5 sub-agents concurrent.

**Delegation mechanisms (host-agnostic):**

Use whichever mechanism the current host provides:

- **OpenCode CLI (non-interactive):**
  `opencode run -m <review-model> "<worker prompt>"`
  Pass the prompt text and checklist inline. Capture stdout for findings.
  (`<review-model>` is the host's configured sub-agent model, not a hard-coded ID.)

- **Host Task / sub-agent tool:**
  Delegate each review batch as a separate task with the prompt text and checklist
  embedded in the task prompt.

- **Fallback (no sub-agent mechanism):**
  The main agent runs the review itself using the same checklist and findings format.
  Do not skip the review — just run it inline.

### Step 4 — Sub-agent prompt template

Use this template when constructing the sub-agent's task prompt. Replace the bracketed
placeholders with actual content.

```text
You are a prompt quality reviewer for BytePlus generative AI models.
Your job is to review prompt(s) against a specific checklist of best practices
and return structured findings. You do NOT fix the prompts — you only identify
issues and suggest fixes.

## Dispatch and request identity
prompt_type: <explicit type>
model: <resolved model>
operation: <generate/edit/extend>
language: <requested language>
requested_axes: <named axes>
request_sha256: <canonical request hash>
required_rule_ids: <IDs supplied by caller>
reference_evidence: <ordered paths, hashes, roles, and approvals>

## Change contract (may change / must preserve)

- MAY CHANGE: <list from the user's request, e.g. "spoken language + lip sync">
- MUST PRESERVE: <list, e.g. "character identity, environment, timing, camera">

## Prompts to review

### Prompt 1: <filename or identifier>
<full prompt text>

### Prompt 2: <filename or identifier>
<full prompt text>

## Review checklist

<paste the applicable checklist section from references/review-checklists.md here>

## Universal directing principles (apply to ALL prompts)

<these are always included — see Universal Directing Principles section below>

## Your task

For each prompt, go through every item in the checklist. For each item:
1. Determine if the prompt satisfies the requirement.
2. If it does not, record a finding.

Return a machine-readable review record, then optional human-readable details:

{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "request_sha256": "<same request hash>",
  "reviewer_status": "complete",
  "checks": [
    {"rule_id": "revision.declared_delta", "status": "pass",
     "evidence": "<specific preserved locks and permitted change checked>"}
  ]
}

Use one check per required rule ID. Status is pass, fail, or not_applicable.
Every not_applicable result needs a concrete applicability reason. Missing
inputs, unchecked required rules, or unusable reviewer output mean incomplete.
For failures include severity, applicability, exact evidence, and suggested fix
in the human-readable details. Do not invent evidence from missing assets.

Report any human-readable findings in this format:

### Review Findings

#### Prompt: <filename or identifier>

**PASS** — no issues found.

OR

**ISSUES FOUND:**

1. [CRITICAL] <Checklist item name>
   - Problem: <what is wrong>
   - Evidence: <quote the relevant part of the prompt>
   - Suggested fix: <specific, actionable fix>

2. [MAJOR] <Checklist item name>
   - Problem: <what is wrong>
   - Evidence: <quote the relevant part of the prompt>
   - Suggested fix: <specific, actionable fix>

3. [MINOR] <Checklist item name>
   - Problem: <what is wrong>
   - Evidence: <quote the relevant part of the prompt>
   - Suggested fix: <specific, actionable fix>

### Severity definitions
- CRITICAL: Will cause generation failure, safety rejection, identity drift,
  or fundamentally broken output. Must fix before submission.
- MAJOR: Will degrade output quality, cause inconsistency, or violate an
  applicable directing rule. Must resolve before submission.
- MINOR: Could improve quality or clarity but won't break the generation.
  Fix if time allows.

## Rules
- Check every item in the checklist. Do not skip items.
- Quote the exact text from the prompt as evidence.
- Suggested fixes must be specific and actionable — not "improve the prompt".
- If a checklist item does not apply to this prompt type, note "N/A" and move on.
- Do not rewrite the prompt. Only identify issues and suggest fixes.
- Be precise and honest. Do not invent problems that don't exist.
- If the prompt passes all items, say so clearly.
- An item listed under MAY CHANGE is a deliberate instruction — do NOT flag it
  as "modifying the subject" or "not preserving the source". Only flag:
  (a) a breakage of something under MUST PRESERVE, or (b) a real quality defect
  in how the changed thing is described (missing guards, missing numeric
  anchors, missing language reinforcement, ambiguity).
```

### Step 5 — Receive and triage findings

If a sub-agent returns an empty, truncated, or content-free result (or findings
without a complete hash-bound record per prompt), record `reviewer_status:
incomplete` and retry the same batch once (max 1 retry).
If the retry is still unusable, run the review inline against the same
checklists. If evidence is still missing, retain incomplete status and block
submission; never treat an empty sub-agent result as passed.

When the sub-agent returns findings:

1. **Read all findings** for each prompt.
2. **Triage by severity:**
   - CRITICAL issues — must fix before any generation task is submitted.
   - MAJOR issues — must resolve before submission. A user-requested creative
     change requires a new applicability decision and review, not a fake pass.
   - MINOR issues — fix opportunistically; surface to the user.
3. **Deduplicate** — if multiple sub-agents found the same issue (e.g., a universal
   principle violation), merge into one finding.
4. **Cross-check** — if the sub-agent flagged something that you believe is actually
   correct, verify against the skill file before dismissing.

### Step 6 — Apply fixes

The main agent applies fixes directly to the prompt files:

1. For each finding to be fixed, edit the prompt file with the suggested fix.
2. Preserve the prompt's structure and formatting conventions.
3. Do not rewrite the entire prompt — apply only the targeted fix.
4. After applying fixes, note what was changed.

### Step 7 — Re-review changed prompts (if any fixes were applied)

If any CRITICAL or MAJOR fixes were applied, re-review the changed prompts:
- Spawn a new sub-agent (or run inline) with the updated prompt text and the same
  checklist.
- Confirm the fixed issues are resolved and no new issues were introduced.
- If new issues appear, fix and re-review again (maximum 2 re-review rounds).
- If issues persist after 2 rounds, surface to the user for a decision.

### Step 8 — Report to the user

Summarize the review results:

```text
## Prompt Review Complete

### Reviewed
- <prompt file> — <prompt type> — <PASS | N issues fixed>

### Findings summary
- CRITICAL: <count> (all fixed)
- MAJOR: <count> (all fixed)
- MINOR: <count> (<fixed count> fixed, <remaining count> remaining)

### Changes made
- <prompt file>: <what was changed and why>

### Remaining issues (if any)
- <prompt file>: <issue> — <reason not fixed>

### Ready for generation
- <prompt file> — READY
- <prompt file> — BLOCKED (<reason>)
```

## Multi-prompt review

When reviewing multiple prompts (e.g., all prompts for a scene's shots):

1. Group prompts by type.
2. Spawn one sub-agent per type (parallel, max 5 concurrent).
3. Each sub-agent reviews all prompts of its assigned type in one pass.
4. Collect all findings, deduplicate, and apply fixes.
5. Re-review only the prompts that had CRITICAL or MAJOR fixes applied.

This is efficient because:
- Same-type prompts share the same checklist — one sub-agent loads it once.
- Different-type prompts run in parallel without blocking each other.
- The main agent only re-reviews prompts that actually changed.

## Universal directing principles

The workspace policy owner is the tracked production contract, with stable
rule IDs in `../../contracts/rules.json`. The bundled checklist provides
modality-specific review guidance, not a competing source of workspace policy.
Its source metadata is `references/rule-provenance.json`; bundle integrity
validation detects unreviewed checklist changes.

Check declared applicability before applying a heuristic: narrative shots need
observable events and intent; static character sheets, location plates, UI,
product references, music beds, SFX, and ambience do not need a story obstacle.
Static assets need composition and visible-consistency checks. Prefer positive
observable direction; concise technical exclusions and explicit preservation
constraints are permitted. Supported parameters are checked against the selected
tool/mode, and exact screen text remains an output-QA requirement.

## Element completeness review

In addition to checking prompt quality, the sub-agent **must** review the
complete set of prompts for a scene or project against the **Element
identification checklist** in AGENTS.md. This is a separate pass from the
per-prompt quality review — it checks whether the plan or prompt set is
*missing* elements that should exist, not whether existing prompts are
well-written.

### How to run the element completeness pass

When the sub-agent receives a set of prompts for review, it also receives:

1. The beat structure / scene description for each shot.
2. The full Elements table from the project's `project.md` or plan (if
   available).

The sub-agent walks every beat of every scene/shot and checks whether every
required visible element has a corresponding reference. Incidental objects
do not automatically require a sheet, and generated native sound does not
require a separate library asset. Canonical inputs may be unresolved during
draft breakdown; dependent production submission requires their evidence:

| Check | What to look for |
|---|---|
| On-camera characters | Do recurring or identity-critical on-camera characters have approved canonical references, while incidental people use approved descriptors? For screen-only callers, lock the visible call UI and describe moving callers/dialogue in text; do not attach character sheets as static screen content. |
| Locations / settings | Do recurring or geography-critical spaces have approved canonical location references? Incidental settings may use scene-level direction or keyframes; a distinct transitional or screen-only setting alone does not require a location sheet. |
| Props (held/operated) | Do branded, recurring, story-critical objects and scene-variant wearables have an approved `prop_` reference? Incidental objects may remain text-only; always-worn outfit items stay in the character sheet. Is independently relevant packaging accounted for? |
| Screen / UI surfaces | Does every phone screen, laptop screen, tablet, monitor, signage, or text-heavy surface that shows specific content have a `screen_` reference? |
| Brand / title cards | Does every ad/scene that needs a brand end card, lower third, or logo plate have a `card_` image defined? |
| Audio assets | Does every explicitly separate or reusable audio asset have a defined source? Native full-soundscape generation does not require separate sound-bed assets. |
| Costume variants | If a character wears a different outfit in different scenes, is the variant noted or generated as a separate prop sheet? |

### Reporting element findings

The sub-agent reports element completeness findings in a separate section:

```text
### Element Completeness Review

#### Missing elements
1. [CRITICAL] <Element description> — appears in <ad/scene> beat <timestamp>
   but a required canonical reference is missing; fidelity cannot be verified.
   Suggested action: Generate a <char_/loc_/prop_/screen_/card_> reference.

2. [MAJOR] <Element description> — referenced in <ad/scene> but not in the
   Elements table. May need a dedicated sheet.

#### Element coverage
- Characters: <count> defined, <count> referenced, <list any gaps>
- Locations: <count> defined, <count> referenced, <list any gaps>
- Props: <count> defined, <count> referenced, <list any gaps>
- Screen UIs: <count> defined, <count> referenced, <list any gaps>
- Title cards: <count> defined, <count> referenced, <list any gaps>
- Audio assets: <count> defined, <count> referenced, <list any gaps>
```

### Severity for element findings

- **CRITICAL:** A required identity/product/text reference is absent from a
  production request, preventing its fidelity requirements from being checked.
  Resolve the required input before dependent submission.
- **MAJOR:** An explicitly required production input is insufficiently defined
  to check its requested quality or continuity. Incidental people/settings and
  native sound do not become missing-reference findings solely from visibility.
- **MINOR:** An element could enhance the production but isn't strictly
  required (e.g. ambient SFX library for a quiet scene).

## Reference file

The consolidated review checklists for all prompt types live in:
`references/review-checklists.md`

Load the relevant section(s) when constructing the sub-agent prompt. The reference is
organized by prompt type with a table of contents at the top for quick navigation.

## Compose with other skills

- After a production prompt passes, return its snapshot path, request hash,
  reference bindings and review result to the caller. The caller freezes the
  reviewed prompt and hands it off paste-ready; generated-media review happens
  in the destination workflow.
- For end-to-end production coordination, say so: it is out of scope in this workspace.
- This skill is called by the main agent during prompt-writing work; it does not call
  generation tools itself.
