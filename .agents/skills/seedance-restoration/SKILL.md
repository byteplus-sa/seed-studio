# Seedance Restoration

Write production-grade **Seedance 2.5 video-to-video restoration prompts** that
clean aged, damaged, or archival footage. This is a generative re-render: the
source clip is the sole editing master, and the prompt directs the model to
erase surface damage while locking everything the shot actually contains.

Use this skill when the user wants to:

- **restore / clean / repair** old, aged, or archival footage
- **denoise** — remove film grain and video noise
- **remove scratch lines** — black lines, white lines, vertical/horizontal
  scratches, hairlines, streaks from aged film prints
- **clean up** dust, dirt, flicker, and compression artifacts

Do **not** use for deterministic VOD AI enhancement or classical denoiser
filters — this skill is the Seedance generative-edit route. For the
general edit grammar and the full six-part formula, compose with
`seedance-prompt-25`; submission and the generation lifecycle belong to the
caller outside this workspace.

> **Known ceiling.** Seedance re-renders the picture; aggressive cleanup trades
> fine-detail fidelity for smoothness, and there is a real limit to how far a
> generative model cleans before it starts re-interpreting the image. Fast,
> thin, time-varying geometric or luminance defects (a rolling scan-line tear,
> a wave/ripple, a bright band) are the hardest case — even with correct
> vocabulary they can be reproduced as "content" rather than erased. If residual
> grain or lines remain after escalation, surface the deterministic alternative
> (temporal denoise + scratch-removal filters, run outside this workspace)
> rather than promising a generative fix.

## Input and output contract

Input: an inspected source clip, the requested cleanup targets, and the
may-change / must-preserve contract.

Output: a Seedance 2.5 structured-edit prompt with the source bound as `@Video 1`.

## Procedure

1. **Diagnose the defect first — never guess the vocabulary.** Get eyes on the
   damaged clip: run an agent video pass when your client can watch the video,
   otherwise extract frames locally (`ffprobe` for duration and fps; `ffmpeg`
   for per-shot frames and short dense bursts across the defect window) and read
   them as images. Characterize the artifact precisely: its exact type (grain,
   scratch line, dust, flicker, a horizontal scan-line tear, a rolling
   wave/ripple, a geometric warp, a luminance band), its direction of travel,
   its timing window, and whether it displaces the image or only changes
   brightness. Misnaming the defect is the single biggest cause of under-fixes —
   a "vertical wave" that is actually a horizontal scan-line tear + luminance
   band will not respond to a wave-removal prompt. Use the diagnosis to drive the
   prompt's vocabulary word-for-word.
2. **Inspect the source.** Probe duration, fps, resolution, and aspect. Read the
   defect mix from the footage and the diagnosis.
3. **Trim to the 30s ceiling — and center the defect.** Seedance 2.5 caps edits
   at 30s. If the source is longer, trim to ≤29s before handoff; the edit
   auto-locks duration to ~input (±0.3s). **For a localized defect, never leave
   it at a clip boundary.** A defect sitting in the final second can be dropped
   or altered by the duration drift (and re-introduced by any last-frame pad you
   add to splice). Re-center the defect with ≥1s of clean margin on both sides.
4. **Choose an escalation level** (below) based on how much cleanup is wanted and
   what the last take under-delivered on. For localized tears/bands/waves, use the
   dedicated framing in [Localized transient defects](#localized-transient-defects-scans-tears-bands-waves) rather than the grain ladder.
5. **Write the prompt** using the canonical template. Make the dominant defect
   explicit and dominant; never bury it in a mixed list.
6. **Verify the fix before relying on it — do not trust a reported success.**
   Ask the user to share the generated clip (or frames from it) and re-inspect
   it the same way (video pass, or extracted frames); check the
   same three things: the defect is gone, the people/scene/camera are intact, and
   no new artifacts were introduced. Only build on a verified-clean clip; a
   reported `succeeded` is not proof the tear/wave/grain actually left.
7. **Original audio re-mux** happens in the destination workflow. Seedance
   regenerates native audio; for "keep everything the same," the user muxes the
   source audio back onto the restored video outside this workspace.

## Escalation ladder

Field-tested levels, least → most aggressive. Escalate one step when the
previous take leaves residual damage; change only the wording and defect
emphasis, keep the preserve-locks stable.

| Level | Dominant target | Key phrasing |
|---|---|---|
| **1 — gentle cleanup** | scratches, dust, grain as a mixed list | "restore and clean the archival footage" |
| **2 — aggressive denoise** | grain / noise | "grain removal is the dominant task — push it hard, frame by frame, until no visible noise or shimmer remains" |
| **3 — scratch lines + grain** | black/white scratch lines **and** grain | "black lines and scratches … are a dominant defect — eliminate every one of them, frame by frame, until no line or scratch remains" |

## Localized transient defects (scans, tears, bands, waves)

A **distinct defect class** from broad grain/scratch cleanup. These are thin,
fast, time-varying geometric or luminance artifacts — a horizontal scan-line
tear (scan lines displaced left/right inside a narrow band), a rolling
wave/ripple, or a washed-out bright/dark luminance band that travels across the
frame. They need different vocabulary and a different mental model:

- **Reconstruct, don't remove.** These artifacts are best framed as *missing or
  corrupted data to rebuild from the clean scan lines above and below the band*,
  not as "a tear to erase." "Remove the tear" tells the model the band is content
  worth keeping; "rebuild the corrupted strip from surrounding clean context" gets
  it to redraw the band cleanly. This is the single most effective phrasing for
  this class.
- **Name it precisely.** A scan-line tear is not a "wave" and not a "geometric
  warp" — wrong vocabulary produces a partial fix. Confirm the exact type from a
  frame pass first (see Procedure step 1).
- **Do not hedge.** For these defects, "aggressively remove" + "completely
  eliminate … through the final frame" is appropriate; the timid "keep everything
  the same" framing lets the model reproduce the band as content.
- **Center the defect in the clip.** These defects are often a ~1s window; put it
  mid-clip, not at the tail (Procedure step 3).
- **Expect the model to sometimes reproduce them.** A rolling tear is the hardest
  restoration case. Verify by re-inspection before splicing; if it persists
  after 2–3 attempts with correct vocabulary, fall back to a deterministic
  temporal repair (motion-compensated interpolation / temporal median over the
  affected frames), which can rebuild the band from neighboring clean scan lines.

### Template (scan-line tear / rolling band)

Deliver with the parameter block: `omni_reference_task_type="edit"`, `generate_audio: false`, `resolution` 1080p.

```text
[Edit Goal]
Edit @Video 1 to <rebuild/eliminate> a <thin full-width horizontal band / rolling
vertical ripple> where <the scan lines are scrambled and displaced / the image is
warped> <and the exposure is washed out and uneven>, rolling <top-to-bottom>, so
the final picture is flat, continuous, and evenly exposed with no seam, while
every person, object, action, composition, camera movement, and timing stays
exactly as it is.

[Edit Scope]
A narrow <full-width horizontal band / vertical ripple> is corrupted: <describe the
scrambling/displacement and the washout>. Treat it as missing data and reconstruct
it from the clean <scan lines above and below / surrounding frames>, so the repair
is invisible. <For rolling artifacts:> It rolls from the <top> edge to the <bottom>
edge and disappears — eliminate it wherever it sits on each frame, through the
final frame, until no seam, misalignment, or exposure mismatch remains anywhere.
Do not change the framing or geometry of the scene. Do not perform broad
film-grain or noise removal; retain the real surface texture of skin, fabric, and
objects. Keep edges crisp — do not soften the image into a blurry or mushy
picture. Do not modify any person's face, body, clothing, or gestures; do not
modify the background objects, set, or props; do not modify the camera movement,
framing, or cuts; do not modify the lighting direction, color grade, contrast, or
exposure. Exactly one of each person remains in frame — never a second or
duplicated copy.
```

## Canonical prompt template (Seedance 2.5 edit)

Deliver with the parameter block: `omni_reference_task_type="edit"`, `generate_audio: false`, `resolution` 1080p.

```text
[Edit Goal]
Edit @Video 1 to <aggressively/completely> remove <dominant defect(s) — name them
explicitly: film grain, video noise, black lines, white lines, vertical scratches,
horizontal scratches, hairlines, streaks>, so the final image is clean, temporally
stable, and free of <grain and line> artifacts, while every person, object, action,
composition, camera movement, and timing stays exactly as it is.

[Source Video Role]
@Video 1 is the sole editing master. It defines the people, their faces, clothing,
and body language, the scene and background, the actions and event order, the camera
position and movement, and the lighting and color.

[Edit Scope]
Aggressively remove all old-film damage across the entire video: film grain, video
noise, black lines, white lines, vertical scratches, horizontal scratches, hairlines,
streaks, dust, dirt, flicker, and compression artifacts. <Name the dominant defect
and push it hard: "…are a dominant defect — eliminate every one of them, frame by
frame, until no … remains."> Denoise temporally so grain does not flicker between
frames, without introducing motion blur, ghosting, or trailing on moving subjects
or the camera. Remove only the film-print grain, noise, and scratch artifacts —
retain the real surface texture of skin, fabric, and objects. Keep edges crisp —
do not soften the image into a blurry or mushy picture. Do not modify any person's
face, body, clothing, or gestures; do not modify the background objects, set, or
props; do not modify the camera movement, framing, or cuts; do not modify the
lighting direction, color grade, contrast, or exposure. Exactly one of each person
remains in frame — never a second or duplicated copy.

[Content to Preserve]
Keep every person's identity, face, expression, body, clothing, and motion from
@Video 1 unchanged. Keep the scene, background, set, props, camera position, camera
movement, framing, cuts, event order, and timing from @Video 1 unchanged. Keep the
lighting direction, color, contrast, and exposure from @Video 1 unchanged. Faces
stay real and natural — never waxy, plastic, or warped; faces stay naturally
grounded in the scene with no cut-out edge, no halo; rim light matches the key
direction.
```

## Guardrails

- **Name the dominant defect, don't hedge.** A mixed list with "keep everything
  exactly the same" makes the model timid and under-cleans. Make the target
  defect explicit and dominant.
- **The discriminator line is mandatory.** Always include "remove only the
  film-print grain, noise, and scratch artifacts — retain the real surface
  texture of skin, fabric, and objects." This is what prevents the model from
  over-smoothing into waxy/plastic skin when you push grain removal hard.
- **Never demand contradictory absolutes.** "Completely remove all grain" plus
  "keep every pore and fine hair" is physically unresolvable and invites
  over-smoothing. Rank the outcome: cleanup first, detail second.
- **Single source reference.** Only `@Video 1` is bound; no image/audio
  references. `[Target Material Role]` is omitted.
- **Preservation locks.** Quantity ("exactly one … never a second or duplicated
  copy"), grounding ("no cut-out edge, no halo; rim light matches the key
  direction"), and face protection ("never waxy, plastic, or warped") belong in
  every prompt that preserves people.
- **Submission.** `omni_reference_task_type="edit"`, `resolution` 480p/720p/1080p
  (2.5 has no 4K), `generate_audio: false` (since the source audio is re-muxed
  afterward — skip the re-mux if you instead keep native audio), `watermark: false`
  only when the tool supports the parameter. Duration auto-locks to the input —
  do not set it.
- **Temporal denoising with a no-ghosting guard.** Always pair the temporal
  instruction with "without introducing motion blur, ghosting, or trailing."

## Self-check checklist

1. The defect was **diagnosed from a video or frame pass** before writing the
   prompt; the prompt uses the diagnosis's exact vocabulary (not a guessed name).
2. `[Edit Goal]` is one sentence, begins "Edit @Video 1 to …", and names the
   dominant defect explicitly.
3. `[Source Video Role]` declares `@Video 1` the sole editing master.
4. `[Edit Scope]` names the change, pushes the dominant defect hard, and carries
   the "exactly one … never a second" quantity guard.
5. The discriminator line ("remove only the film-print … retain real surface
   texture") is present — or, for a localized tear/band, the
   reconstruct-from-surrounding-context framing is used instead.
6. Temporal denoising is paired with the no-blur/ghosting/trailing guard.
7. `[Content to Preserve]` locks identity, motion, timing, camera, and lighting.
8. Grounding and face-protection locks are present when people are in frame.
9. No `[Target Material Role]` section (single `@Video 1` source only).
10. Source trimmed to ≤29s, and any localized defect is **centered** with ≥1s
    clean margin on both sides — never at the clip boundary.
11. The Seedance output was **verified by re-inspection** (defect gone, content
    intact, no new artifacts) before splicing.
12. Original audio re-mux happens in the destination workflow.
