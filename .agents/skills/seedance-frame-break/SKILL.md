# Seedance Frame Break

Frame break is a pop-out look: two flat black bars sit at the top and bottom of
a 16:9 picture, the scene lives in the window between them, and the subject's
nearest limbs or clothing are drawn complete on top of the bars in full colour.
The subject appears to burst out of the screen toward the viewer.

This is a prompt-writing leaf. It delivers a paste-ready block in chat for
Lumina or another Seedance UI and never generates, uploads or submits anything.

## Composition

| Concern | Owner |
| --- | --- |
| Six-part formula, `@Image N` roles, timestamp rules, audio brackets | `seedance-prompt-25` |
| Locked-off camera wording | `seedance-camera-presets` |
| Identity reference for a character | `seedream-character-sheet` |
| Medium and material rules for a stylised subject | `seedance-animation-styles` |
| End cards, taglines or any on-screen text | Out of scope here; added in post by the destination workflow |
| Real brand or product assets | [Element identification](../../contracts/element-identification.md) |

These are composition hints; this leaf does not load sibling skills. Do not
restate the base grammar here.

## The technique in one screen

Three layers, back to front:

1. **Scene**: the backdrop fills only the central window between the bars.
2. **Bars**: two flat, solid black graphic bars, about 12 percent of the frame
   height each, static, laid over the picture. They are graphics, not the
   camera's letterbox.
3. **Subject**: drawn complete on top of the bars wherever it crosses them, in
   full colour, never clipped or hidden by a bar.

Supporting rules:

- The camera is fixed and locked off, with a wide-angle look. This is part of
  the effect, not an elective camera axis; add lens, lighting or grade wording
  only when the user asks for it. The subject does not travel toward the lens;
  scale grows only for the limb or hem that extends.
- Break-outs are events, not a state. The subject is full-body and completely
  inside the central window at the start and at every stage boundary, with both
  bars fully visible and clear of it, and fills about two thirds of the window
  height. Each break-out is a brief, specific limb or hem extension during a
  stage (a fist and forearm over the upper bar, a robe hem flaring over the
  lower bar), after which the subject returns inside. Between break-outs
  nothing overlaps a bar. The subject never walks or leans closer so that torso
  or legs end up over a bar.
- The bars never move. Their inner edges stay perfectly straight, horizontal and
  at the same height in every frame; whatever covers them sits on top and never
  changes them, and when a limb withdraws the straight edge is simply visible
  again. Moving bars fail the take.
- Keep any extending limb from filling a third of the frame: a near-lens limb
  or head distorted the bar edge. This is about protecting the bars, not about
  making the subject big.
- Bars of 17 to 21 percent shrink the window and push the subject over them.
  Ask for about 12 percent and state once that the central window is the large
  majority of the frame height.
- The lower bar is crossed far more reliably than the upper bar. The upper bar
  needs its own stage, a limb or hem that plausibly reaches it, an explicit peak
  ("the open palm covers the upper bar") and an End state back inside.
- If the model reads the bars as camera letterbox, the subject stays behind or
  clipped by them and the effect is lost. Describe the bars as an overlay and
  give numeric overlap anchors.

## Input and output contract

Input:

- A brief: subject type, scene, mood, audio intent, and whether bars are wanted
  at the default of about 12 percent.
- Approved identity references (a character sheet, or real product photos) with
  their rights status confirmed by the user.
- Duration and resolution from the user's destination settings; they belong in
  the parameter block, not in prompt text. The ratio is 16:9.

Output, delivered in chat: ordered `@Image N` bindings and roles, the seven
prompt blocks below as one paste-ready block, a parameter note (`16:9`, the
lowest suitable resolution, audio per the audio intent, watermark handled in
the destination UI), the preflight result and open items. Freeze the exact
prompt text before handoff; a repaired prompt is a new version that records the
one thing changed. Suggest a few takes of the same frozen prompt so the cleanest
can be chosen; the user sets the count.

## Required prompt blocks

Write them in this order. Read
[prompt template](references/prompt-template.md) for the slots and a worked
example.

1. **Identity lock.** `@Image 1` defines the subject's face, hair, clothing and
   art style only. State that the sheet layout, panel borders and background
   are ignored. Never ask the output to reproduce the sheet.
2. **Main idea.** One sentence: who bursts out of the black bars and how,
   followed once by a sentence fixing the bars: two fixed black bar graphics
   with perfectly straight horizontal inner edges at the same height in every
   frame.
3. **Four timed stages.** Each stage has one coherent action by one named limb
   (use screen-left and screen-right), the bar it crosses with a numeric
   anchor such as covering about a third of the bar's width, the crossing
   direction, the moment it peaks, and an observable `End state:` with the
   subject back fully inside the window and nothing over a bar. The limb that
   arrives at the lens is the limb that crosses the bar; no other limb takes
   over mid-stage, and two different limbs never cross in the same beat. Other
   limbs stay small and tucked behind until a later stage.
4. **Frame and layer order.** The three layers back to front, the bars as
   flat static 2D graphics drawn under the subject, never moving or bending,
   with the constant-height phrase repeated and the rule that whatever covers
   them never changes them. State once that the central window is the large
   majority of the frame height and the subject is full-body inside it,
   except during the named break-outs.
5. **Camera.** Locked off, no movement, zoom or cuts; only the subject moves.
6. **Audio.** Requested sound arc in the `seedance-prompt-25` bracket syntax.
   When no music is wanted, say so.
7. **Closing exclusions.** Short: no text, captions, logos or watermarks, no
   held props, bars unmarked. Keep necessary exclusions to one or two lines.

Stage roles: stage 1 establishes the full-body subject inside the window with
no overlap and may add a small first gesture; stage 2 has a lower-bar break-out;
stage 3 has an upper-bar break-out; stage 4 delivers the hero break-out and
resolves back inside. Every stage begins and ends inside the window. Timestamps
are time allocations, so the End state should be reachable about half a second
before each boundary. Do not state the clip duration in prompt text.

## Procedure

1. **Route check.** Confirm the request is a frame-break effect, not ordinary
   letterbox or a camera move, and not an edit of existing footage.
2. **Subject and scene.** Pick the subject type and a calm backdrop. Read
   [scenes and subjects](references/scenes-and-subjects.md).
3. **Product only.** For a product-only hero ad read
   [product hero](references/product-hero.md) before writing.
4. **Write** the seven blocks from the template.
5. **Preflight** with the checklist below; fix every failed item.
6. **Deliver** the prompt, bindings, parameter note and open items in chat.
7. **Returned takes.** When the user reports or supplies a take, give them the
   [acceptance check](references/acceptance-check.md) to run. When the take
   itself is available, inspect it by agent video pass if the client can watch
   it, or by local `ffmpeg` frame extraction read as images if it cannot; never
   claim to have watched footage you could not access.
8. **Repair** with [failure modes](references/failure-modes.md): change one
   thing at a time and write the result as a new prompt version; re-rolling the
   same wording did not help.

## Preflight checklist

- [ ] The three layers are stated back to front.
- [ ] The bars are flat, static 2D graphics drawn under the subject, about 12
      percent of the frame height, with no promise of exactness.
- [ ] The bars are fixed once early (perfectly straight horizontal inner edges,
      same height in every frame) and the layer-order block repeats the
      constant-height phrase and says whatever covers them never changes them.
- [ ] The subject is full-body and completely inside the window at the start and
      at every stage boundary, about two thirds of the window height, with no
      walking or leaning that puts torso or legs over a bar.
- [ ] Each break-out is a brief limb or hem extension inside one stage, after
      which the subject returns inside; nothing overlaps a bar between them.
- [ ] No extending limb or head fills a third of the frame, and the window is
      stated once to be the large majority of the frame height.
- [ ] No scene object resembles a bar (ropes, rails, beams) near the bar
      position.
- [ ] `@Image 1` is bound to face, clothing and style only, with the sheet
      layout excluded.
- [ ] There are four stages, each with one coherent action by one named limb
      and an observable End state; no stage chains two unconnected limb actions
      or names two different limbs crossing in the same beat.
- [ ] The upper bar has its own stage, a limb that can reach it, an explicit peak
      and an End state back inside.
- [ ] Every crossing has a numeric anchor, a crossing direction and a return.
- [ ] Left and right are given as screen-left and screen-right.
- [ ] Gaze, spin and sweep directions do not contradict each other.
- [ ] The camera is locked off with no zoom or cuts.
- [ ] No held props unless the subject is the product.
- [ ] The backdrop is calm, darker than the subject, with different colours and
      no lettering.
- [ ] The clip duration is absent from the prompt text.
- [ ] No on-screen text or logo is requested; any text is planned for post.
- [ ] The audio request states whether music is wanted.

## Usage limitations

- Timestamps allocate time; actions arrive about 0.25 to 0.5 s late and are not
  frame-accurate cut points.
- Bars are approximate in thickness and may differ top versus bottom. Never
  promise exact geometry. Bars that tilt, bow or jump are not a limitation to
  accept: moving bars fail the acceptance check, and a take that moves them is
  rejected, however well the subject crosses.
- A sudden scale jump or limb swap inside a stage fails the check. It is found
  by reading every frame of each stage at about 12 fps, not by sparse sampling.
- A prompt improves the odds of overlap; it does not guarantee it. Judge overlap
  from frames, and treat a video-understanding model's summary as secondary
  evidence only.
- Photoreal subjects cross the bars less often than drawn ones.
- A take whose subject starts over a bar, or overlaps a bar for most of the
  clip, reads as standing outside the frame and fails the break-out check even
  when the bars are perfectly static.
- Real logos on a product distort. Exact text and logos are post-production
  material, not footage, and are out of scope in this workspace.
- Do not bind a mock-up or storyboard of the effect as a reference; describe
  the layers in text.
- Frame inspection cannot judge audio; listen to it.
- This workspace ships no pixel-measurement tooling, so bar thickness and
  overlap are judged by eye from frames.

## Evidence labels

Distinguish the kind of claim when it affects a decision: **observed result**
(reported upstream from Seedance 2.5 takes at 1080p, October 2026, each row
naming its take; conditions stated, not re-run in this workspace and not a
guarantee), **documented convention** (owned by `seedance-prompt-25`) and
**optional technique** (a hypothesis to test).

| Claim | Label |
| --- | --- |
| Describing bars as flat overlay graphics with numeric overlap anchors fixed takes where the subject sat behind the bars; re-rolling the same wording did not | observed result |
| Bars measured 9.4 to 18.9 percent of frame height when about 12 percent was asked, often unequal; about 7 percent once when treated as letterbox | observed result |
| Bars were static within 1 px in most takes; one take had a lower-bar bow up to about 4.6 percent and one a 0.25 to 0.5 s edge jump with the subject very close to the lens | observed result |
| A photoreal boxer take was rejected for moving bars: the lower bar's inner edge tilted, bowed and jumped as a whole for 0.25 to 0.5 s when the subject leaned very close to the lens; sampling every 0.5 s and an 8 fps scan did not flag it clearly | observed result |
| Extreme foreshortening, a limb or head very close to the lens, is the observed cause of bar-edge distortion | observed result |
| A photoreal boxer take with static bars (17.5 and 21.1 percent measured) was rejected because the subject was outside the window from the first frame, with legs, shorts and robe over the lower bar for most of the clip (overlap in about 80 percent of frames), so it read as standing outside the frame; the earlier keep-it-at-arm's-length repair overcorrected | observed result |
| Takes the user accepted overlapped a bar in about 15 to 65 percent of frames and began inside the window | observed result |
| Ring ropes and rails near the bar zone were drawn as bars; the model painted a real-brand logo on background bags despite plain, unmarked wording | observed result |
| A stylised 3D fox take was rejected: the fox reached out with a paw, then a giant bare cream sole appeared at about 1.25 to 2.0 s and filled half the frame, a scale jump and limb swap from two unconnected limb actions in one stage; the sole also differed from the sheet's teal sole | observed result |
| Drawn subjects gave 3 to 5 strong overlap moments; photoreal subjects gave 1 to 3 | observed result |
| Calm, darker, lower-contrast backdrops with colours that differ from the subject read well | observed result |
| Avoid the word letterbox in the prompt; keep other limbs small and tucked behind until their stage; make each break-out a brief event that ends back inside | optional technique |

## Submission boundary and failure behavior

This leaf returns the prompt package without generating media. When the user
explicitly asks to generate and a transport is connected, follow
[Generation transport](../../contracts/generation-transport.md): show the exact
frozen prompt, confirm each submit, one transport per job. Missing identity
references, unresolved rights for a real brand asset, or a request to bake text
into the footage stay open items in the package; say that on-screen text is
added in post by the destination workflow, which is out of scope here, rather
than improvising a prompt for it.
